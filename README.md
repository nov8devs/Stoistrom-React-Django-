## Introduction

Welcome to the Stoistrom React Django project! This repository contains the source code for an application built with React for the frontend and Django for the backend. Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

    ```

3. Inside the project directory, you will find three main folders: `frontend`, `backend`, and `venv`.

## Frontend (React)

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
